ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AlbertK-Dev, a developer with a strong interest in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on improving my skills in JavaScript and TypeScript, while also exploring Python for scripting and web scraping, and Java for object-oriented programming.
ðŸ’» I have a good understanding of OOP and design patterns, and Iâ€™m always open to learning more and embracing new challenges.
ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m happy to collaborate on projects involving JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and Python.
ðŸ“« Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if youâ€™d like to work together!
